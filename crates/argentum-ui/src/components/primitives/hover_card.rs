/// A hover card component: a card of detail about its trigger, shown while
/// the trigger is hovered or focused.
///
/// Where a tooltip carries a few words, a hover card carries a view: the
/// person behind a mention, the project behind a link. Child nodes are the
/// trigger and the [`hover_card_content`] holding that view.
///
/// The card waits before it appears, so that passing the cursor over the
/// trigger on the way somewhere else does not summon it, and waits again
/// before it goes, so that the way to it is not a race. What is in it is
/// detail, not the only copy of anything: a reader who never hovers, and one
/// on a touch screen, will not see it.
///
/// ```ignore

/// between is named in the transition with `allow-discrete`, since it has no
/// in-between values; naming both properties one by one is what makes that
/// work, as `all` does not carry the visibility along.
