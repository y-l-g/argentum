/// A tooltip component: a hint that shows while its trigger is hovered or
/// focused.
///
/// Child nodes are the trigger and the [`tooltip_content`] holding the hint.
/// The hint shows on hover and on keyboard focus, both of which are the
/// browser's own doing, so nothing here needs scripting. It also never moves
/// out of the way of the viewport's edge, which does: keep hints short, and
/// give the content a side that has room.
///
/// The hint is only a hint. Say what the trigger does in the trigger itself,
/// through its text or an `aria-label`, since a reader who never hovers will
/// not meet the tooltip at all.
///
/// ```ignore

/// covers. It sits above the trigger, centered on it, and takes no pointer
/// events, so hovering along the way to it never gets in the way of what is
/// underneath.
///
/// It fades in on hover and on focus within the trigger, and the visibility
/// that keeps it out of the way in between is named in the transition with
/// `allow-discrete`: it has no in-between values, so without that it would
/// snap and the fade would play against a hint that is already gone. Naming
/// both properties one by one is what makes that work; `all` does not carry
/// the visibility along.
