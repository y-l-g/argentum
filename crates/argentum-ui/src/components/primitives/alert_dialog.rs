/// assistive technology announce it as a question rather than as another
/// panel. Everything else is the dialog's: build the inside out of
/// [`dialog_content`](super::dialog::dialog_content),
/// [`dialog_header`](super::dialog::dialog_header) and the rest, and give the
/// footer the choice to make. Leave out any way of closing it that is not one
/// of the answers, since a reader who dismisses the question is left where
/// they started.
///
/// Naming the panel for assistive technology takes an `aria-labelledby` among
/// the `attrs` pointing at the title, and an `aria-describedby` pointing at
/// the description. The `attrs` are otherwise forwarded to the underlying
/// `<dialog>`.
