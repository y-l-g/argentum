/// An accordion component: sections that fold away until they are asked for.
///
/// The accordion is a stack of [`accordion_item`]s, each of which opens and
/// closes on its own without scripting. Letting only one stand open at a time
/// takes no more than giving every item the same `name`, which the browser
/// reads as them belonging to one another. The `attrs` (such as `class`) are
/// forwarded to the underlying `<div>`; a `class` among them is appended to
/// the computed classes.
///
/// ```ignore
/// view! {
///     accordion(
///         for (question, answer) in questions {
///             // The shared name is what closes the open item when
///             // another is opened. Leave it out to let several stand
///             // open at once.

/// animated, since the content's height is not a number the stylesheet knows.
/// The visibility the browser switches along with the state is named in the
/// transition too, with `allow-discrete`: it has no in-between values, so
/// without that it would snap and take the content with it, leaving the
/// height to slide over nothing. Both properties are listed one by one rather
/// than covered by `all`, which does not carry the visibility along.

/// and close the section outright, which is what a `<details>` does anyway.
