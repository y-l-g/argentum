/// A tabs component: one panel at a time out of several, picked by the row of
/// triggers above it.
///
/// Which panel shows is server state: a [`tabs_trigger`] is a link, and the
/// page renders the [`tabs_content`] for whichever one the URL names. The
/// panel is therefore shareable and survives a reload, at the cost of a
/// navigation when switching. Because the triggers are ordinary links, this
/// is a navigation rather than the ARIA tab pattern, which expects the arrow
/// keys to move between tabs and needs scripting.
///
/// The `attrs` (such as `class`) are forwarded to the underlying `<div>`; a
/// `class` among them is appended to the computed classes.
///
/// ```ignore
